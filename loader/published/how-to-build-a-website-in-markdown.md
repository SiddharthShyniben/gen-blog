# How to build a website in markdown

This thing is in the middle of the page because of the DEV Markdown parser. Go <a href="https://gist.github.com/SiddharthShyniben/2e33d096f6173ae8688ca046ded151cd">Here</a> for a better one

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
I just got bored so I just made a website using a tables like in the old days (Just for fun)<br><br>
Doesn't it look cool? No CSS (except DEV's default stylesheet, no JavaScript, just good 'ol HTML.<br><br>
I mean, I can't believe I built this. I'm so bad at CSS. Not like I used any CSS.

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>
This is just a bunch of tables. Here's what it looks like in pseudocode:<br> 
<pre class="highlight html"><code>table
    row 
        top menu thingy spanning 2 cols
    row 
        side menu thingy
        content
            another table
                row
                    column with content
                row
                    column with content
                ...
    row
        footer spanning 2 cols
</code></pre>
<br>
<h4>...Wait. So this is HTML, not markdown right?</h4>

Yeah I guess, pretty much HTML. But <strong>limited</strong> HTML.

<h4>You can't put markdown in HTML. S- S- So, Did you t- t- type out all this (gulp) HTML?</h4>

Yes I did. It took some time to figure out how to highlight code blocks and stuff, but I did eventually did it.<br>

<h4>So, how good is this?</h4>

Really bad, like literally the worst. <br><br>

This is really hard to maintain. Like seriously, I spent half an hour putting together the table (not the content!)<br><br>

There's a lot more stuff to think about, like the fact that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html#:~:text=the%20layout%20algorithm%20for%20tables%20is%20much%20harder%2C%20the%20browser%20often%20has%20to%20wait%20for%20the%20whole%20table%20to%20load%20before%20it%20can%20begin%20to%20layout%20the%20content.">tables load kinda slower</a><br><br>

This thing is literally two nested tables. Lets not start talking about a11y.
