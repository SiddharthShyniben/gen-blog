# GitHub for storage

I've been seeing GitHub repositories used for many things other than code – awesome lists, music, travel logs. But the next thing is data storage. [Utterances, for example,] (https://github.com/utterance/utterances) is a commenting system that creates a new GitHub issue for every blog post written and syncs its comments and blog post comments.

I could see myself making a whole blog based on GitHub, and hosted on GitHub pages – All blog posts are in a folder. A GitHub action converts all the blog posts in the folder to a static site. Wanna write a guest post? Open a PR. Comments could be based on GitHub issues. Spellcheck in checks. Code review. Line comments. And much, much more.

And this is not only for GitHub. For example, an app that uses a blogging platform's API could store its config as a draft post. And so on. And I can't wait to see what people make of this.
