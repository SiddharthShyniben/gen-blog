# Get to MDN faster: mdn.io

Today I discovered this gem of a site: [mdn.io](mdn.io), [The "I'm feeling lucky" URL Shortener](https://github.com/lazd/mdn.io#user-content-deployment:~:text=The%20%22I'm%20feeling%20lucky%22%20URL%20shortener,-mdn.io)

The Mozilla Developer Network is an awesome JavaScript resource. When looking for JavaScript references on something like Function.apply, you might use a search engine with "apply site:developer.mozilla.org" and click the first result.

mdn.io does that for you.

You can try out a bunch of urls. Try visiting

- [mdn.io/bind](mdn.io/bind)
- [mdn.io/closure](mdn.io/closure)
- [mdn.io/cross origin sharing](mdn.io/cross origin sharing)

On it's [repo](https://github.com/lazd/mdn.io), It says that mdn.io uses DuckDuckGo's Bang! functionality to redirect you to the first search result.

It's really nice someone has made this.
