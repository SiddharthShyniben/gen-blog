# Say something from the terminal

Today I learned about the `say` command in macos. You use it like:

```console
$ say something
```

It may not seem useful, but I use it when I have long scripts to run...

```sh
npm run build && say "build done"
```

...and It can also be used to do fun things...

```sh
say abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz # The impossible is possible
say dskfjkhadsfhjkasjhkfgjdasgfj 
```
