# On HTML

Just a few days ago, my Angular CLI broke, and I was forced to code some [stuff](https://siddharthshyniben.github.io/webdown) in plain old HTML â€“ No transpiling, no compiling, no build tools other than my hands on the keyboard.

It was a simple task, but I was bent on building it in Angular. But I couldn't and had to write it in plain HTML.

This made me think â€“ If I had used Angular for such a small task,
- The code would be _wayyyy_ bigger, because of all the Angular stuff
- I'm 99% sure that it would have taken _wayyyy_ more time to build â€“ It almost felt like I wrote the app in HTML in the same time it takes for Angular to create a project using `ng new` ðŸ˜ƒ

Writing HTML felt tremendously liberating. It felt nice to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which will be delivered to the end users.

Don't get me wrong â€“ I absolutely recognize why complex pipelines are important for complex websites. If you're part of a big group, you in all likelihood want to have processes in place so that everyone can contribute to the codebase in a consistent way.

But that setup isnâ€™t appropriate for each website. And all those equipment and techniques which are supposed to save time every now and then waste time down the road. Ever had to revisit a project after, say, six or twelve months? Maybe you just want to make one little change to the CSS. But you canâ€™t because a dependency is broken. So you try to update it. But it relies on a different version of Node. Before you know it, youâ€™re Bryan Cranston changing a light bulb. You should be tweaking one line of CSS but instead, youâ€™re [battling entropy](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/).

I think we should cut down. No more [weighty](https://dev.to/leoat12/the-nodemodules-problem-29dc) `node_modules`; just crispy HTML, CSS and JavaScript
