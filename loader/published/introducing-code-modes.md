# Introducing Code Modes

Lately, I've been finding myself showing/hiding folders/files again and again depending on what I am doing. To make this easier, I created a VSCode extension called Code Modes.

{% github SiddharthShyniben/code-modes %}


Basically, there are a bunch of modes, which you can choose. When you are in a certain mode, certain files get excluded from the file tree. 

For now, the extension is very basic (I made it in 1 day and I had the most amazing feeling when it worked bug-free) and there is no way to add custom modes, etc. 

If you have any suggestions for any modes, feel free to comment!
