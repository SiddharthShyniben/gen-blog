# Should I make a Git tutorial

_Should I make a Git tutorial? All the other tutorials seem really abstract with no real example projects._

Or, more accurately, _I just recently read through the Pro Git book and now I feel like I have superpowers and I thought I could build a tutorial but I am a bit low on motivation so motivate me_

:sweat_smile:
