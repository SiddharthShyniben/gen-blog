# Discussion: How would you go about testing a bot which plays a game?

Suppose you made a game playing bot (like [stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) for example). How would you check if the bot is good enough?

As you might have guessed, I was planning creating a bot so I thought I would put this question here. Maybe that bot will get it's own article.

PS: this is my first post!!
