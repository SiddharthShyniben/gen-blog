# I'm switching to vim!

I just took a short look at the (neo)vim docs, and I'm officially moving to (neo)vim (and tmux)! I have just used it for a few days, but I really can feel the power it gives me. Not to mention that it really saves my 6GB ram for other uses.

And I encourage all of you to do the same. It really is super faster (I come from vscode, and it is really faster). Vim has everything you need â€“ Syntax highlighting, Split screen, File explorers(!), Autocomplete(!), Tabs, Folding lines(!), Indentation autofixing(!), macros, line bookmarks, integrated terminal like interface and what not (I should make an article on it soon). Vim is basically equivalent to VSCode for me.
