# What JS Concept should I explain?

I've learned a lot from the DEV community and I would love to give back. For this reason I have created this Series.

If you want an explanation of any JS concept, you've come to the right place! Comment what you want to learn about and I will try to respond to every request with a new post in this Series.

Please don't be misled by the word "concept". I will try to do anything JS related, but no libraries!

Happy Learning!
