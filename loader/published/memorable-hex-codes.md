# Memorable Hex codes

Hopefully this will save you a trip to the color picker.

- **#b00b00 (deep red)**        - Good for errors
- **#de1e7e (pink)**            - Delete
- **#2fa (green)**              - Looks like tha 2FA was successful
- **#ac1d1c (red, obviously)**  - Warning! Extremely corrosive
- **#facade (pink)** 
- **#goodn8 (almost sky blue)**
- **#c0ffee (teal)**            - Yeah teal coffee
