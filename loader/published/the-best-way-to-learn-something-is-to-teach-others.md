# The best way to learn something is to teach others

They say the best way to learn is to teach. I ***strongly*** agree. 

## Wait, how is that possible?

- It only makes sense that you will work harder to understand and be more aware of the material you are teaching, whether you know it or not. You will be forced to really dig into the "why" behind whatever you are teaching and use it yourself until it becomes completely natural. 
- Additionally, the real act of writing makes stuff stick in your minds

This is why they have stuff like rubber duck debugging (Quack overflow!), where you explain your code line by line to a rubber duck to find out errors. I even use a variation of this, _writing_ (again, _writing_) questions on stackoverflow, finding the solution myself, and discarding drafts. I do this like everyday. When we have to explain stuff, it automatically becomes clear in our own minds.

## I don't know enough!!!

Don't worry about that, you will eventually learn when you teach. If you don't know everything, teach the basics.

And also, have you never heard of the French saying _"prÃªcher le faux pour savoir le vrai"_ or the more internet based [Cunningham's law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law) which states that "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

**Key takeaway:** write more tutorials, because it not only helps others, it helps you
