# Git GUI vs Git CLI

I recently read through the Pro Git book. It's an awesome book. <sub><sup>(but I think it's a bit abstract â€“ I could make my own git tutorial, what do you say?)</sup></sub> I learned a lot about the Git CLI and now I'm temporarily leaving GitHub Desktop.

What about you guys? Do you use a GUI or the CLI?
