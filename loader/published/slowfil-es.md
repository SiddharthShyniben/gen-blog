# slowfil.es

| [Direct link »](https://slowfile.es) |
| ------------------------------------ |

Neat little project here made by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) and [Ryan Townsend](https://www.twnsnd.com/) called [slowfil.es](https://slowfil.es), which is used to – you guessed it! – load files slowly. Might be useful for testing out apps which load resources.

You only get support for `js` and `css` files for now, but that may change later.
