# I made a new JavaScript operator!

Can you figure out how?

```js
let x = 10;
// The new arrow operator – goes from one number to another
while (x --> 0) { // x goes to 0
  console.log(x)
}
```

{% runkit %}
let x = 10;
// The new arrow operator – goes from one number to another
while (x --> 0) { // x goes to 0
  console.log(x)
}
{% endrunkit %}
