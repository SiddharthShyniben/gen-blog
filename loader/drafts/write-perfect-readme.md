# write-perfect-readme

## TL;DR

Check out my [community-health](https://github.com/siddharthShyniben/community-health/) repo, star it if you like, and follow the instructions in it's README to quickly get started.

A good README is a good way to show people what your project does, and why it matters, and here I'll show you how to write a good README.

## Core concepts

Your README should be concise, and it should be answering these questions:

>	1. What is this project doing? (Write a short description)
>	2. Can I use this? (What do I need to install to be able to install this?)
>	3. If I can use it, how? (How to install? Any minimal code snippets?)
>	4. How can I help? (What license? Contributing guidelines?)
