        <p>In this post, I am going to explain how I plan my programming projects. Planning a project can make it easier for you to keep away from feature creep and recognize what to do next. Take some time to research this vital skill and you may see your productivity thrust upwards.</p>
<center><strong>Good projects need a robust foundation, a dependable and reusable schema which can help you and potential contributors know what to do and what not to do, and when to do it.</strong></center>
<p>Now let's get right into it!</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we are going to plan the building of a Notes app as an example.</p>
<p>I like to divide the planning into two parts: <strong>Sandboxing</strong> and <strong>Listing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sandboxing</strong> is the part where we <strong>determine all the possible features</strong> your app will have. This will involve <strong>drawing a mind map</strong>. I will use an online tool in this example, but only because my drawing is really bad ðŸ˜…. Feel free to use any tool (paper works best).</p>
<p><strong>Listing</strong> is the part where we <strong>take the sandboxed mind map and convert it into an actionable, prioritized todo list</strong>. Once again, feel free to use any tools you like.</p>
<h2 id="sandboxing"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#sandboxing"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Sandboxing</h2>
<p>Before we start, create a mind map. The name of the root of the chart should be the name of whatever you are building. It should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/asryan5jxqpdqu3x8eln.png" alt="root"></p>
<figcaption>The base</figcaption>
<h3 id="step-0-forget-everything-else"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-0-forget-everything-else"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Step 0: Forget everything else</h3>
<p>You may have some great piecemeal ideas which you want to add. For now, <strong>forget them</strong> or write them down somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-identify-the-pain-points"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-1-identify-the-pain-points"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Step 1: Identify the Pain Points</h3>
<p>First, draw a branch for Pain Points:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z9g1f8bxqej5ilukfxo2.png" alt="pain points branch"></p>
<figcaption>The pain points branch</figcaption>
<p>Pain points are the "problems" that your project solves. Usually, projects have a single pain point but you can come up with more. For example, Netflix removed the "pain" of traditional movie rentals. Make a new branch for each pain point you make.</p>
<p>You can think of this as the base of the outline. It is the central focus of everything, so put some thought into this.</p>
<p>One way of coming up with pain points is to compare it with other ways of doing what your project does.</p>
<center>Note: When you are starting out, don't compare your project with other projects, just compare it with what someone would do if there were no other projects like this. When you have a working project, you can think of comparisons.</center>
<p>For our example, let's compare our Notes app with a piece of paper and make some pain points:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n4t7l2hojwkgcujae9tl.png" alt="pain points"></p>
<figcaption>Basic pain points</figcaption>
<center>If you just want to build something that you think is awesome, thatâ€™s superb, and don't let something like finding 'pain points' stop you. However, each piece of software must have a central focus. So locate that earlier before you start building anything! You can even add your piecemeal ideas mentioned in <a href="#step-0-forget-everything-else">Step 0</a>!</center>
<h3 id="step-2-plan-your-features"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-2-plan-your-features"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Step 2: Plan your features</h3>
<p>Now, we can start planning features which our software will offer.</p>
<p>Keeping our pain point(s) in mind, we can start to think of what cool features we want our software to have. As we create this primary "layer" of features, we should constantly be asking ourselves, "Is this feature going to help solve our paint point?" If not, itâ€™s probably a waste of our time to code it. This should keep feature creep in check.</p>
<p>On your mind map, add a new branch for features. Then, add sub branches to list every feature you want. You can also link each branch to it's pain point.</p>
<p>Depending on your project, you might want to add sub features. The more layers the better, because it helps to have small actionable tasks rather than big ones. Keep going until you feel that a component is small enough that you can build it easily.</p>
<center>Note: You can even add your piecemeal ideas mentioned in <a href="#step-0-forget-everything-else">Step 0!</a></center>
<p>For our example, let's list our features of our note taking app:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fh40zj2c9we1y33krl87.png" alt="features branch"></p>
<figcaption>Now this is getting interesting.</figcaption>
<p>That's about it for the <strong>Sandboxing</strong> part.</p>
<h2 id="listing"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#listing"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Listing</h2>
<p>Now, we have to create a Todo list of stuff to do. I'll be using an app, but you can choose anything.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zetvpta8oimxc4lqdsiq.png" alt="The base"></p>
<figcaption>The todo list</figcaption>
<h3 id="step-0-dump"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-0-dump"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Step 0: Dump</h3>
<p>List everything in the features branch of your mind map into your todo list in a new section called <strong>Dump</strong> or <strong>Icebox</strong>. Don't mind sorting or prioritizing â€“ just dump. The only important thing is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>All features have been accounted for</li>
<li>The features are detailed enough for you to understand</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's how it looks like for the example notes app:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i1fk3te2bovqijigvq24.png" alt="Example"></p>
<figcaption>There's more... too much to show</figcaption>
<h3 id="step-1-create-a-bunch-of-sections"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-1-create-a-bunch-of-sections"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Step 1: Create a bunch of sections</h3>
<p>Create some sections which will help you prioritize tasks. The sections may vary with projects, but I like to make 3 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic</strong> (the bare minimum features)</li>
<li><strong>Useful</strong> (the stuff which differentiates your software from basic alternatives)</li>
<li><strong>Bonus</strong> (the stuff which differentiates your software from other similar software)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0481d9js6chm51unz9mg.png" alt="Screen Shot"></p>
<figcaption>After creating sections</figcaption> 
<h3 id="step-2-sort"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-2-sort"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Step 2: Sort!</h3>
<p>Now, you can take your tasks from the <strong>dump</strong> and place them into their own sections. Put the bare minimum tasks into the basic section, and so on.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks like for the notes app:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xas0lnx7szddsn9evzgg.png" alt="Screen Shot"></p>
<h3 id="step-3-prioritize-and-add-dates"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-3-prioritize-and-add-dates"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Step 3: Prioritize and add dates</h3>
<p>Even in the sections some tasks have a higher importance. For example, creating notes has a higher priority than deleting them and so on. Now you have to prioritize your tasks based on importance.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks like for the notes app:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n7exm3mkav6epf9hd8lf.png" alt="Screen Shot"></p>
<figcaption>Color represents priority</figcaption>
<p>The next thing to do is add due dates to each task. You have to guess how long a feature takes and add a date accordingly. If you are unsure of how long tasks take, just double your estimates.</p>
<p>If you are starting right away, you might add "today" as the date for the first tasks in the basic section, "tomorrow" for the second and third tasks,  and so on.</p>
<center>You might want to make similar functionality on the same day, and that's totally ok. For example you might want to make the note tagging and note coloring feature on the same day because they are easy to do together, and you can do that</center>
<p>Here's how it looks for the notes app:</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t75zr9vit1cn90axgil4.png" alt="Screen Shot"></p>
<p>And that's it! Now you got a actionable todo list and you can start on your project!</p>
<h2 id="future"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#future"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Future</h2>
<p>Now that you've made a todo list, you can do these things to further improve your workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can create an <strong>issues</strong> and a <strong>pull requests</strong> section, and add all new issues and PRs to your todo. You could even automate! (Tell me in the comments if you want a tutorial for that)</li>
<li>You could create a <strong>in progress</strong>, an <strong>up next</strong> and an <strong>in review</strong> section which will really be useful for teams</li>
<li>Instead of checking off tasks, you could create a <strong>done</strong> section so you can stay motivated.</li>
<li>Whenever an idea pops up, add it to the <strong>dump</strong> section. Once you've really thought about the feature and are sure that it is useful, you could add it to one of the sections</li>
<li>And much more! It all depends on <strong>you</strong></li>
</ul>
